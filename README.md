# Azure Bootcamp 2018 Session 2 Notes and Lab Walkthrough

This session is designed to help understand some of the basics of deploying Azure Resources with the use of tools such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code and a Git repository such as Visual Studio Team Services. During the course of this session, we would be looking at deploying the various tiers of Azure resources which would form the base for a highly redundant Azure Web Site hosted on Azure App Service.
